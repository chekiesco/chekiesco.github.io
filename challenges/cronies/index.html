			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Getting kids to commit to nutritious choices can lead to a healthier lifestyle. Schools have the opportunity to foster good habits early on. But accommodating picky eaters and dealing with outside influences, such as the media, family, and peers, can be daunting.</p>
			<p>Design an experience where schools can influence students’ food choices. Show your process and how you arrived at your solution. Please include a sequence of high-fidelity mocks from your design solution.</p>
			<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Want to understand who I am and what I will bring to Google’s UX community</li>
					<li>Submit work that I feel is representative of me as a designer.</li>
					<li>Stand-alone doc so: provide all the necessary context and processes so it's clear to the reviewers how I run my process</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 1: Why</h2>
			<p>The amount of food products has been increasing exponentially in recent years, however, eating habits have remained the same for decades.</p>
			<p>People care more about their health. Interaction with the nutrients in the food can mean the difference between a good life or the end of it at a premature age, therefore, having a nutrition education has become necessary. Nutrition education at an early age is important, children can learn good habits, prevent diseases and prolong their life.</p>
			<p>The creation of an educational nutrition program is an opportunity for schools to use technology as a learning tool, build trust with parents and encourage them to continue the nutrition education at home, which will lead to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 2: Who</h2>
			<p>Considering the problem, the <strong>audiences</strong> that our solution would appeal to:
				<ul>
					<li>Children</li>
					<li>Parents or Tutors</li>
					<li>Department of Education</li>
					<li>Schools</li>
					<li>Teachers</li>
					<li>Nutritionist</li>
					<li>Retailers</li>
					<li>Producers</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Taking into account the duration of the challenge, I’d <strong>focus</strong> on three groups:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Children</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Parents or Tutors</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Teachers</strong> (with a specialty in nutrition)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Although children will be an important factor in the solution, parents and the people who are caretaker of the education of the kids will be fundamental to achieve the goal correctly.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 3: When & Where</h2>
			<p>The interaction between children, parents, and teachers is usually initiated by the parents when they want to increase the education of their child to improve their health and prevent bad habits and diseases.</p>
			<p><strong>Parents context</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>When</strong>: Interaction will start when they want to know, analyze and evaluate the nutrition habits of their children. It could be because they want to anticipate their children behavior or are eating with them and notice something that surprised them.</li>
					<li><strong>Where</strong>: They could evaluate the knowledge at home, work or on the go.</li>
					<li><strong>Feelings</strong>: Anticipation, joy, surprise, and trust. Parents might want to anticipate their children behavior, feel good, proud or satisfied with their education and then trust teachers. They could also be surprised by the current state of knowledge.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<p>The role of the teacher is essential since he/she will be in charge of helping the children to acquire knowledge, competencies, and values.</p>
			<p><strong>Teachers context</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>When</strong>: Teachers will start to grade children in order to know if they have acquired the knowledge, which will lead to a good evaluation and the satisfaction of achieving the objective of teaching.</li>
					<li><strong>Where</strong>: They could evaluate the knowledge at home, school or on the go.</li>
					<li><strong>Feelings</strong>: Anticipation, joy, surprise, and trust. Teachers might want to anticipate children knowledge and prevent a lack of learning. They want to feel satisfied with the education that they are giving to tutees but they could also be surprised with the grades.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<p>Finally, the most important actors are children.</p>
				<strong>Children context</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>When</strong>: Children will show the knowledge acquired in different ways: at the time of being hungry, when it is time to eat and when they are evaluated by their teachers.</li>
					<li><strong>Where</strong>: They could be evaluated anywhere (at home, restaurant, etc).</li>
					<li><strong>Feelings</strong>: Anticipation, friendship, joy and trust. Children might want to anticipate their grades by studying and evaluating their knowledge. They want to feel friendship, the bond of joy, and will come together with their friends and schoolmates and have fun. They want to gain the trust of their parents and teachers in order to be able to invest more time in their interests.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 4: Ideation</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Social-network Game</strong>: A social-network game that connects with a physical toy, where children must feed (using a the social-network game) their toy to unlock new skills and accessories, depending on the rest and feeding habits.</li>
				<li><strong>Smart Toy Watch</strong>: A smart toy watch that helps children measure their rest and nutritional habits, add what they have eaten and receive recommendations about healthy dishes and good habits.</li>
				<li><strong>Intelligent Lunch Box</strong>: An intelligent lunch box where children see changes in the appearance and features of the lunch box depending on the food they eat.</li>
				<li><strong>Mentor School-network</strong>: Create a school social network where students of advanced years can unlock more game time on their tablets by helping the youngest students to improve their eating habits.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 5: What</h2>
			<p>To choose an idea, I evaluated each one with the following criteria:
				<ul><strong>Impact</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Reach: how many readers could potentially reach.</li>
						<li>Value: how satisfying this solution is for readers.</li>
						<li>Potential revenue: how well this solution meets the business goals (generate retention and a meaningful incentive for the users).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Effort</strong>: how hard it would be for the company to build it.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Solutions <strong>#1</strong>, <strong>#2</strong> and <strong>#3</strong> require more effort since they require both physical and digital solutions, which will need making agreements with third parties (manufacturing companies).</p>
			<p>The solutions with the greatest impact are <strong>#1</strong>, and <strong>#3</strong>.</p>
			<p>Talking about idea <strong>#4</strong>, the effort is less than the others, but it involves the child spending more time using a digital medium, which I <strong>assume</strong> is something that parents don’t want and children will prefer to use their "<em>technology time</em>" in something more attractive.</p>
			<p>The solutions with a better rating (greater impact and less effort) is <strong>#1</strong> because it reaches a large number of users (all those children who want a like playing with toys but also tablets), it covers direct needs (acquire knowledge, learn while playing, evaluate knowledge) and although the effort is greater (for having to connect the physical toy with a social-network game) can attract more children.</p>
			<p>In addition, by including <em>third-parties</em>, a new <strong>business opportunity</strong> is created.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h2>Step 6: Solution</h2>
			<p>During the idea prioritization process, I noticed that idea <strong>#1</strong> could be complemented with idea <strong>#4</strong>, so I improved proposal <strong>#1</strong> by including the mentoring of "<em>advanced students</em>".</p>
			<p>This is where I added the <strong>first restriction</strong>. The word "<strong>kids</strong>" is very broad so I had to restrict the age range. Taking into account the age ranges mentioned by <strong>Debra Levin Gelman</strong> in his book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-kids/9781457103148/" target="_blank">Design for Kids</a>, I decided to discard all those children under 6 years old and focus on two ranges: "<strong>The Big Kids</strong>" and "<strong>The Cool Factor</strong>".</p>
			<p>"The Big Kids" (6-8) are starting elementary school. They start being influenced by what their peers do instead of what the adults in their lives do, so that's where "The Cool Factor" (8-10) will participate. “The Cool Factor” kids feel like they are not little kids anymore and feel confidence and independence, so their actions will earn them the confidence of "The Big Kids".</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Interviews</h3>
			<p>In order to better understand the behavior of the audience, I conducted five <strong>informal interviews</strong> (phone calls and text messages) with <strong>parents</strong> and <strong>teachers</strong> of children between <strong>6</strong> and <strong>10</strong> years old.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Parents</strong><br />
				I interviewed Ramses Moreno (father of a 6-year-old girl and a 10-year-old girl), Ivan Garcia (father of a 6-year-old girl) and Karina Meneses (mother of a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy). I asked about the children's use of technology (both at home and at school), the restrictions and preferences of children today.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Teachers</strong><br />
				Additionally, I interviewed Helena Ayala (third-grade teacher in elementary school) with Catherine Morel (fourth-grade teacher in elementary school). The conversation focused on the use of technology as a tool for education, as well as education on eating habits at an early age.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Insights</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Teachers</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Schools use technology to teach how to use a computer (by using a desktop computer). Few schools have integrated the use of tablets (shared between three or four students).</li>
					<li>The education on nutrition, habits, and benefits is very poor. Children learn about the “Healthy Eating Plate” (what it is and the percentage of each group that they should eat), but there’s no learning related with benefits, food groups, measuring or how to track nutrition habits.</li>
					<li>Children are prohibited from taking devices to school, the school is the one that provides the devices.</li>
				</ul>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Scope</h3>
			<p>After defining tasks I realize that the amount of work to create the idea, so I had to define the <strong>scope</strong>.</p>
			<p>Which <strong>deliverables</strong> would be necessary to pitch the solution and business strategy to stakeholders?</p>
			<p>Showing how it will work with children is important in order to explain how we are going to build trust (between children, parents, and teachers), create engage and focus on the audience needs and behavior.</p>
			<p>I decided to create a prototype of the “The Big Kids" <strong>user-flow</strong>: Connect tablet with smart-toy, track food and compare with schoolmates (in order to understand the importance of the nutrition habits).</p>
			<p>Since it’s necessary to show how teachers will assign activities, a mockup of the <strong>teachers' dashboard</strong> will also be included.</p>

			<h3>Getting Started User-flow</h3>
			<p>The first flow is where a child will connect the toy with the application.</p>
			<p>The child should bring his teddy closer to the tablet. Once detected (via Bluetooth), the application shows the name of the avatar (nickname) and the name of the child and helps the child to change the user in case another teddy has been detected.</p>
			<p>The child needs to confirm if the tablet detected the right teddy.</p>
			<p>Once confirmed, the child goes to the home screen and can choose four options:
				<ul>
					<li>Feed (add data about what the child has eaten)</li>
					<li>A measure (used to learn how to take measurements and the meaning of these measurements)</li>
					<li>Check (where a child can see a history of their diet and recommendations).</li>
					<li>Sign-Out</li>

			<h3>Step 6: Functional Prototype</h3>
			<p>I create a <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/J3R3KG1MDS4#/screens/353203019" target="_blank">functional prototype</a> where the following tasks can be achieved:
				<ul>
					<li>Synchronize a toy

			<h3>From Wireframes to Prototype</h3>
			<p>Taking into account the wireframes transition – user-flows – mockups – prototype, I prepared the toolkit to make it easier.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> for User Interface, and with the help of symbols and styles, making the transition between wireframes and mockups is very simple. For the prototype and taking into consideration the time, I decided that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a> would be the best solution.</p>
			<p>Once the wireframes were created, I prepared the project to collaborate, so I assigned specific names and numbers to each screen, facilitating the process of following up on each specific screen.</p>
			<p>It was time to create mockups. The first was to create a color palette considering the audience. For this, I used the <a href="https://material.io/tools/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&primary.color=4527a0&secondary.color=FFC400" target="_blank">Material Design Color Tool</a> to choose the primary and secondary color and thus create a color palette. For typography, I did a search for children's styles within <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
			<p>For working with a development team, they could use the Inspect mode to see the specifications (an alternative will be <a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank">Zeplin</a>).</p>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Teachers' Dashboard</h3>
			<p>Taking into account the wireframes transition – user-flows – mockups – prototype, I prepared the toolkit to make it easier.</p>
			<p>With the flow of the children done and functional prototype working, I worked on a proposal of the dashboard that the teachers will use.</p>
			<p>Going back to the list of tasks performed, I focus on the task that the teacher will be doing:
				<ul>
					<li>Manage students (add, change status, remove)</li>
					<li>Schedule daily activities</li>
					<li>Grade challenges</li>
					<li>Manage badges (change status)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>I created a proposal where the teacher could have an overview of their students, as well as access to relevant information: scheduled activities, view pending challenges (from the fourth-grade students), as well as a quick way to do recurring actions (such as add student and schedule an activity).</p>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Naming & Branding</h3>
			<p>When I researched Google's solutions for kids, I found the integrations that <a href="https://classroom.google.com" target="_blank">Google Classroom</a> has, so I decided to create a parallel product with which Google Classroom could connect.</p>
			<p>Taking into account the children, I thought about the poetically constructed names that are based on rhythm and the experience of saying them.</p>
			<p>Using a thesaurus to look for words similar to a friend, I found the word <strong>Crony</strong>.</p>
			<p>I assume that children will like saying “cronies” (when talking about the smart-teddies), is going to be easy to remember and is rich with potential marketing energy.</p>

		<div class="columns figures">
			<h3>Mockup</h3>

		</figure>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Step 7: Measure Success</h3>
			<p>The final thing I did is to define KPIs that will indicate the success of this solution and the numbers which would be considered a success. If this solution is successful we’ll see:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Tracking meals success rate</strong>: percentage of child adding meals during class.</li>
					<li><strong><strong>Task completion time</strong>: children manage to add the meals of the previous day in the time allotted by the teacher.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Engagement</strong>: How often teachers assign Daily Activities to their students.</li>
					<li><strong>Retention</strong>: How often do parents review the statistics of their children's habits.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				After getting the results, a decision can be made:
				<ul>
					<li>Continue with the smart-teddy solution or create a better way to continue the teaching at home.</li>
					<li>Let teachers schedule daily activities or set predefined daily activities.</li>
					<li>The data parents are able to see and analyze is enough or there is additional information they need to cover their needs.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>In addition, we will need to measure the understanding of the children application. For example, if the child does not add the meals completely after two or three classes, the application is distracting him from the task or the steps are too complicated for the children.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
			<h3>Additional Information</h3>
			<p>Additional information that I would like to add to the solution:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Blind Spots</strong>: When working with an imaginary project and with a complex audience (children), the behavior of the application, as well as its business strategy are based on assumptions. With the additional time, a validation using formal <strong>user interviews</strong> would help to validate the different assumptions and running <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong> in order to improve the interface.</li>
					<li><strong>Scope</strong>: the challenge is focused on the solution of tracker for kids, however, with more time, I would split the challenge in two in order to work on the parents’ solution.</li>
					<li><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: Due to the flexibility and capacity of <strong>Material Design</strong>, it was used for the creation of the dashboard proposal. By using an ecosystem with guidelines as clear as Material Design, the Visual Design process becomes easier.</li>
				</ul>
